# Tools for the mirroring of repositories 

## Components

### 1. Git Large File Storage (LFS): Sounds promising

"Git Large File Storage (LFS) replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise."

### 2. Duplicating/mirroring repository

A true mirror (if we are not to push things to the origin, I believe)

### 3. LDAD authentication and authorization

Should be easy to add an external contributor through Active Directory
