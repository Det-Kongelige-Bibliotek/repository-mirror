# Repository mirror

A tool for mirroring data from a GIT repository into a digital library
service. More specifically, a set of XML text documents maintained
using GIT should be possible to mirror into an eXist database and from
there into a SOLR search engine.

This performs some of the functions available in the github project
[solr-and-snippets](https://github.com/Det-Kongelige-Bibliotek/solr-and-snippets). Just
some of them.

As a matter of fact, if you are the admin of a service like
www.adl.dk, those tools are the only you'll need. This is for
providing access to some of those functions for people not very much
into working on stuff from a Unix shell prompt while saving (we hope)
the admin's time.
