# Repository mirror

A tool for mirroring data from a GIT repository into a digital library
service. More specifically, a set of XML text documents maintained
using GIT should be possible to mirror into an eXist database and from
there into a SOLR search engine.

This overlaps with the tools available in the github project
[sol-and-snippets](https://github.com/Det-Kongelige-Bibliotek/solr-and-snippets). As
a matter of fact, if you are the admin of a service like www.adl.dk,
those tools are the only you'll need. This is for providing access to
some of those functions for people not very much into working on stuff from a Unix shell prompt.
